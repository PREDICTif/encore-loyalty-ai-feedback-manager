Build a streamlined React-based interactive web app prototype:

Overview:
 Develop a React-based web application that simulates an AI-driven feedback response system for restaurants. The application should allow users to input and manage structured facts about the restaurant, customer, and system settings, and generate AI-crafted responses to customer feedback using OpenAI’s API. A minimal, elegant UI that demonstrates an AI-driven feedback response system for restaurants.

Technology Stack:
 • React frontend (TailwindCSS for styling).
 • JSON for fact management.
 • OpenAI API for response generation.

⸻

UI Layout (single page app):

Header:
 • “Encore Loyalty AI Feedback Manager” centered, prominent.

Main Section (grid or flex layout, clear separation):

Facts Input/Editor (left half):
 • 3 clearly labeled and visually distinct collapsible sections or tabs:

1. Restaurant Specific Facts:
   • Editable fields (prepopulate from JSON):
   • Name, Address, URL
   • Restaurant Type (dropdown: Casual, Upscale, Fast-food, Fine dining, etc.)
   • Brand tone (dropdown: Formal, Casual, Friendly, Professional)
   • Editable “to-do” style list of facts (users can dynamically add/remove items)
2. Customer Specific Facts:
   • Editable fields (prepopulate from JSON):
   • Name
   • Gender (M, F, Unknown)
   • Customer History (dropdown: Long-time, Recent, Unknown, Free entry)
   • Meal type (dropdown: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Unknown, Free-form)
   • Editable “to-do” style list for additional custom facts (users dynamically add/remove)
   • Image upload (optional), User can upload a screenshot of the customer feedback taken from the app.
3. System Facts & Settings:
   • Editable fields (prepopulate from JSON):
   • System prompt template (editable textarea)
   • Default Response Length (short, medium, detailed)
   • Toggle options (checkboxes):
   • Include Apology if feedback negative
   • Include marketing message if feedback positive
   • Enable multiple response variations (disabled initially, for future)

   Users will have the ability to generate or regenerate the response, which is what shows in the right half of the screen.

AI Response Generation (right half):
 • Large Text Area labeled clearly: “Customer Feedback Screenshot/Extracted Text”.
 • Prepopulated with realistic examples.
 • “Generate AI Response” button beneath textarea.
 • Display box below button (bordered, shadowed) clearly showing AI-generated response.
 • Ability to save the response to a file or send email to the customer.

⸻

Backend Logic (simple):
 • Load/save all facts to structured JSON files.
 • Call OpenAI GPT (use GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 initially) to generate the response based on facts & feedback input.
 • JSON structure clearly matches UI sections.

Initial AI Prompt Template (customizable in System Facts):

You are a customer relationship manager for a restaurant named "{Restaurant Name}", located at "{Address}".
The restaurant type is "{Restaurant Type}" and communicates with a "{Brand tone}" tone.

A customer named "{Customer Name}" ({Gender}), a "{Customer History}" customer, recently had "{Meal type}" and left feedback: "{Customer Feedback Text}".

Consider the following additional restaurant facts: {Restaurant Todo List Facts}

Consider the following additional customer facts: {Customer Todo List Facts}

Generate a thoughtful, concise response addressing the customer's feedback appropriately. If feedback is negative, consider a polite apology. If positive, consider a friendly marketing message inviting them back.

Replace placeholders with actual fact data during API call.

Initial JSON Example (facts.json). This might be enriched with more facts and data from the restaurant and customer later:

{
  "restaurant_facts": {
    "name": "Sample Bistro",
    "address": "123 Main Street, Anytown",
    "url": "[https://samplebistro.com](https://samplebistro.com)",
    "type": "Casual",
    "brand_tone": "Friendly",
    "todo_facts": ["Currently running Summer Specials", "Famous for seafood dishes"]
  },
  "customer_facts": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "gender": "M",
    "history": "Long-time",
    "meal": "Dinner",
    "todo_facts": ["Prefers window seating", "Usually orders vegetarian dishes"]
  },
  "system_facts": {
    "prompt_template": "Default template from above",
    "response_length": "medium",
    "include_apology": true,
    "include_marketing": true,
    "multiple_responses": false
  }
}

⸻

Interaction Flow:
 • User edits facts or adds new ones dynamically.
 • User edits or pastes customer feedback.
 • User clicks “Generate AI Response.”
 • Response appears clearly below, generated via OpenAI API.
